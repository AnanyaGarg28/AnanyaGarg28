# Ananya Garg

Hi there! I am Ananya Garg, an upcoming software engineer at Microsoft. I'm pursuing B.Tech in Software Engineering at Delhi Technological University(graduation in May 2024). Full-stack developer(prefer front-end work) with experience in MERN Stack(React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB), Typescript, MUI, TailwindCSS, SaSS, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, Flask and C++.

What I've done during my college years:

- Selected for the Microsoft Engage program in 2022, where I built a full-stack web application called 'Bongrub', to help foodies(like me) get the latest recipes from around the world and satisfy their taste buds. The app is integrated with a recommendation engine, which forms the soul and heart of it. Do check it out at(open to any feedback) ->

- Following this, I bagged a chance to interview with Microsoft, for a Software Engineering Summer Internship role(2023). Appeared for the interview in just 18 hrs after knowing about it, got my best-self, and after a week, landed the offer!

**Learnings**: The interview itself made me learn a lot of things(as I was just a sophomore). I analysed my project deeper, the security, authentication and authorization issues, best-coding practices, etc. As it was built in Javascript, Flask and Python, I went curios about improving the codebase, its features and scalability. To solve some of these, I started learning React, which completely changed my game. 

I explored and learnt it through documentation, Linkedin Learning, and project-building to solidify my understanding of concepts. Started looking out ways to contribute to open-source. It made me hunt for my next opportunity as an intern to gain experience, on how organizations write real code for production, build scalable aplications.

- A month later, I got a text from the founder of Preimage, interviewed with them, delivered an assignment and appeared for another interview(with a panel of 4 interviewers). Hell nervous, this time to be interviewed by a panel of 4, definitely an experience to be remembered. I was excited and skeptical of the results, but gave my best. Towards the end of the call, they extended me the offer. I happily accepted the offer and interned with them for about 8 months, managing my college academics, along. It was such an enriching experience to be the youngest in the team and being able to deliver quality deliverables over the time. The team and my manager were very supportive, gave me challenging work, helped me upskill. I'm lucky to have experienced such a good working culture, even as an intern, which was something I didnt' expect in return. Happy to contribute!

- Summer of 2023, Joined Microsoft as a Software Engineering Intern at Microsoft. Worked to create a real-time data ingestion framework for Payments Data Platform. Used an entirely unfamiliar stack of technologies - PySpark, Databricks, Microsoft Azure, PowerBI. Completed the project end-to-end with data monitoring, logging, alerting ensuring data completeness, accuracy and general availability. This 8-week internship was successful as I recieved a PPO - full-time SWE Offer to join Microsoft in 2024(post graduation in May 2024).

- Fast forward to Jan 2024, bagged another Software Engineering(Full-Stack) Intern with BlokTrek(PrivateBlok). Currently working on extracting text/images from file formats(pdf, docs, ppts) using GPT4-vision, Textract, Python-Docx, Doc Intel, etc. while building the serverless infrastructure using AWS. The most exciting part - Getting to learn new things everyday! ðŸŒŸ
