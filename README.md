# Ananya Garg

Hi there! I am Ananya Garg, an upcoming software engineering intern at Microsoft. I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Software Engineering at Delhi Technological University with an expected graduation in 2024. I am a front-end leaning full-stack developer skilled in React.js, Typescript, MUI, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, HTML, Node.js, Express.js, Python, and C++. 

I was a part of the Microsoft Engage program 2022, where I build a full-stack web app called 'Bongrub', to help foodies get the latest recipes froma round the world and satisfy their taste buds. The app is integrated with a recommendation engine, which forms the soul and heart of it. Do check it out at ->

After I completed this mentorship program, I got to interview with Microsoft, for a full-time Software Engineering internship role for the summer of 2023. The interview was scheduled the very next day, when I got to know about my candidature. Gave the interview, got my best-self, and after a week, landed the offer!

This interview opportunity made me learn a lot of things. I analysed my project deeper, the security and authorization issues, best-coding practices, etc. As it was built in Javascript, Flask and Python, I went curios about improving the codebase, its features and scalability. To solve some of these, I started learning React, which completely changed my game. I explored and learnt it through courses available on Linkedin Learning, read the documentation and started looking out ways to contribute to open-source. It made me hunt for my next opportunity as an intern to gain experience, on how organizations write real code for production, build scalable aplications. During my search, I built many projects to build my concepts and understanding, while applying for remote internships. 

A month later, I got a text from the founder of Preimage, interviewed with them, delivered an assignment and appeared for another interview(with a panel of 4 interviewers). Hell nervous, this time to be interviewed by a panel of 4, definitely an experience to be remembered. I was excited and skeptical of the results, but gave my best. Towards the end of the call, they extended me the offer. I happily accepted the offer and interned with them for about 8 months, managing my college academics, along. It was such an enriching experience to be the youngest in the team and being able to deliver quality deliverables over the time. The team and my manager were very supportive, gave me challenging work, helped me upskill. I'm lucky to have experienced such a good working culture, even as an intern, which was something I didnt' expect in return. Happy to contribute!

Now, I am excited to embark upon my journey as a software engineering intern at Microsoft and contribute to cutting-edge technology. Super energized to leave an impact and make the best out of this opportunity!
